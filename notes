A brief introduction to R
Techniques for building models from a table of data
Using the models to make predictions
Evaluating the accuracy of a model
Using simpler models in place of complex calculations


This set of tutorials is intended for anyone who needs to analyse data, especially if you have *lots* of it. Even if you learned some statistics previously, I think this tutorial will give you a deeper understanding of the concepts, and help you avoid common mistakes. I will also show how to use R to do the analysis. The topics will include:

Analysing the population distribution
Population parameters (mean, variance, standard deviation)
Visualising discrete data
The Normal Distribution
Central Limit Theorem
Evaluating whether or not a distribution is normal
Visualising continuous data
Binning the data
Probability Density Function
Kernel density curve
Species
Simple random sampling
Sample statistics
Comparing two distributions
QQ plots
Stratified sampling
Cluster sampling
Systematic sampling
Convenience sampling





Lessons 1-2
An intro to R
Linear equations
Linear regression methods
 - parametric: least squares
 - exploratory (non-parametric): LOWESS
 - robust: lqs
Making predictions based on the regression
Reversing the regression
Goodness of fit
 - outliers
 - residuals
 - fitting for for prediction vs. structural analysis
Curve fitting
Goodness of fit, revisited
 - outliers
 - residuals
 - Analysis of variance

Additional topics that I plan to cover in future lessons are listed below. They are in no particular order, but I've grouped related topics together. I am open to suggestions on other topics. Also, I will encourage the students to tell me about their data analysis problems, which may inspire additional topics to cover. My best guess is that there will be about 10 lessons in total. If there's interest, at the end we'll have a "data clinic" where people can discuss specific problems they're having, and everyone can participate by suggesting approaches.

Types of "averages": mean, median, mode
The normal distribution
Standard deviation
Variance
QQ plots
Likelihood function
quantiles

discrete data vs. continuous data
probability densities
uniform distribution
binomial distribution
poisson distribution
exponential distribution
normal distribution revisited

rolling averages and other statistics
trend analysis

Conditional probabilities
Bayes' theorem

hypothesis testing
law of large numbers

correlation and causation
multivariate regression analysis
choosing an appropriate sample size
choosing a representative sample
probability sampling vs non-probability sampling
varying the sample in response to potential problems
